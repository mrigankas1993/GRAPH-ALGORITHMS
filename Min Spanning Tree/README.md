My implementation of Kruskal Algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree.The following implementation of Kruskal's Alogrithm
in Python with my own coding logic. I learn the concepts from the CS 106B Lecture 23 Graphs: Spanning Trees (Kruskal's Algorithm) 
of Stanford University. The above implementation is based on the learning concepts from the lecture.
